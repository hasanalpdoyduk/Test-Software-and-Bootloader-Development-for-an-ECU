/**
 * Generated 16-bit Bootloader Source File
 * 
 * @file     boot_demo.c
 * 
 * @brief    Example boot loader implementation.  This file determines:
 *           - when to stay in boot loader mode
 *           - when/how an application image is verified
 *           - when to jump to an application
 *           - when to load a backup application image
 *           - when to load a newly downloaded image (if there is a separate download image slot) 
 *
 *           It is intended that the user will replace/modify this file to meet their
 *           design needs.  This file provides an example implementation.
